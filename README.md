# Description
This program package will install the Servo B&R package that will contain the ServoMgr program for a Automation Studio project and all its dependencies.  
The ServoMgrInit program will perform simple initialization of parameters if needed.
The ServoMgrCyclic program will call the AxisBasicFn_Cyclic function block which handles much of the basic axis control.
The cyclic program also calls the axisErrorCollector function which will support axis error handling.

# Installation
To install using the Loupe Package Manager (LPM), in an initialized Automation Studio project directory run `lpm install servomgracp10prog`. For more information about LPM, see https://loupeteam.github.io/LoupeDocs/tools/lpm.html.
